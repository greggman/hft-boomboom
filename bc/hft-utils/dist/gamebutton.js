  /**
   * Manages a button.
   *
   * You often want to know when a button transitions from
   * released to pressed. This class tracks the state of a button
   * including those transitions
   *
   * I don't know if this is overkill or not. In most games I've
   * written in the past they are local player games. I'd have
   * a joypad library that reads that pads and has flags for
   * which buttons are currently held down and which buttons
   * where pressed this frame.
   *
   * In this case though I have N players that join at random.
   * Seems kind of silly to have a class/object per button per
   * player but it does make it simple to use
   *
   * Similarly the fact that it assumes entitySystem exists
   * and actually uses it to "process" seems overkill but
   * at the same time to removes the need for the user of
   * this class to have to manually call some `update` function.
   *
   * I could make it so calling 'on' or 'justOn' does the processing
   * but that also seems like it might be hard for the user to remember
   * he can only call `on' or 'justOn` once per frame and only
   * one or the other.
