# hft-sample-ui

This is a sample UI library for HappyFunTimes.

It is intended only be a sample. It mostly deals with the
controllers displaying things like the user's name input,
and the "disconnected" message.

It also includes code for displaying virtual dpads
and a few other things.

It's *a SAMPLE*. You can use this as an example
to build your own.
